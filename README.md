# syn-char-gen

This repo has resources for generating synthetic characters. 
I have included the complete project for better discoverability.
I show how to preprocess and integrate the data generation and
machine learning processes.

You can watch a video on the finished product [here](https://youtu.be/LWcssfLz1e8).

Happy hacking!
